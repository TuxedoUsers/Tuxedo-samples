# addressbook Sample Application
A simple address book demonstrating various implementation languages and clients.  So far what's available:
1. Partial Java implementation that can run in Tuxedo's Java Server, doesn't have any persistence yet.
2. Servlet based user interface using Jolt
3. Service definitions and VIEW32 description
4. Jolt repository bulk loader file for the services
5. COBOL server implementation - currently under construction
6. Servlet based user interface using WTC - currently under construction


Thoughts for some more parts:
1. HTML 5 client implementation using RESTful services from SALT
2. Server implementations in other languages, such as scripting languages and C#
3. ?
