Prefer to start with a new feature by examining an application that uses that Tuxedo feature?  Well this is the place for you.  The goal of this project is create sample Tuxedo applications that illustrate features of Tuxedo and its related products such as SALT, TSAM Plus, and Tuxedo ART.\r\n\r\nTuxedo provides a number of sample applications and one in particular, bankapp, shows how to use a number of Tuxedo features.  But bankapp is sorely dated and doesn't illustrate any of hundreds of new features that have been added to Tuxedo since Tuxedo 7.1.  It would be good to show case for example:\r\n\r\n- Multiple lanugages: So services developed in each of the supported languages which currently includes C, C++, COBOL, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java.  Perhaps even some \"mainframe rehosted\" transactions using ART.\r\n\r\n- Multiple interfaces:  So not only Tuxedo interfaces such as Jolt and /WS, but Web service interfaces using  SOAP or REST\r\n\r\n- Multiple clients/UIs:  Web based using Jolt, Web based using Tomcat running in the Tuxedo Java server, Mobile or HTML5 using REST, etc.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nTo get started using Tuxedo, you need to download the Tuxedo installer from the Oracle Technology Network website.  Although it is licensed software, you can play with it and develop with it under the OTN Developer License which basically allows you to use Tuxedo as long as you don't got into production with it.  Once you put the software into production, you need to license it.\r\n\r\nThe download site is: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/tuxedo/downloads/index.html\r\n\r\n## Developing in C or C++\r\nIf you want to develop in C or C++ under Windows, you will likely need Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010 which can be downloaded from:  http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_4   Linux users can just use the standard gcc compiler and libraries.\r\n\r\n## Developing in Java\r\nIf you want to develop in Java, you will need JDK 1.6 or later.  There is a sample Tuxedo Java application located in the Tuxedo installation directory (assuming you picked installing the samples) in `$TUXDIR/samples/atmi/javaapp`\r\n\r\n## Developing in dynamic scripting languages\r\nTuxedo supports several dynamic scripting languages as part of the core Tuxedo installation.  They all basically use the [Service Component Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Component_Architecture) to define and access services.\r\n\r\n### Developing in Python\r\nIf you want to develop in Python, you will need Python 2.x for your platform.  You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\r\nThere are sample Tuxedo Python applications at `$TUXDIR/samples/sca/calc_python` and `$TUXDIR/samples/sca/simp_python`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Developing in Ruby\r\nIf you want to develop in Ruby, you will need Ruby 1.x, although Ruby 2.x might work. You can download Ruby from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)\r\nThere are samnple Tuxedo Ruby applications at `$TUXDIR/samples/sca/calc_ruby` and `$TUXDIR/samples/sca/simp_ruby`\r\n\r\n### Developing in PHP\r\nIf you want to develop in PHP, you will need PHP which can be downloaded [here](http://us2.php.net/downloads.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tuxedo and Python Tutorial\r\nA great getting started Tutorial for Tuxedo and Python is [here](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/fmw/tuxedo/11g/r1/developingpythoncomponents/developingpythoncomponents.htm)\r\nIt's a little dated in that it is designed for older versions of Tuxedo, and uses SALT (which used to be required to develop Tuxedo applications in scripting languages, but no more).\r\n\r\n## Tuxedo and PHP Virtualbox Virtual Machine\r\nAnother simple way to get started with Tuxedo is to download a developer VM from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html#tux).  Again, it's a slightly older version of Tuxedo but it's a great way to get started.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
