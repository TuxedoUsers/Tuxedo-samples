This sample is used to call remote webservice via GWWS's outbound facility.
This sample runs with the bankapp. Please do the following procedure to run it.

1. Set up the environment variable for GWWS.
export FLDTBLDIR32=$APPDIR
export FIELDTBLS32=$FIELDTBLS32,stockquote.fml32,stockquotes.fml32
export XSDDIR=$APPDIR
export XSDFILES=stockquote_1.xsd
export SALTCONFIG=$APPDIR/saltconfig

2. Generate the files from GWWS:
After set the environment of Tuxedo, you can use following command to create
the configure files and client application.
   make 

3. Copy stockquote.fml32, stockquotes.fml32 stockquote.rps and stockquote_1.xsd to bankapp
   make install

4. Edit the ubb configuration to add GWWS

Add a group:
GWWSGRP		GRPNO=100 LMID=SITE1

Add servers for the GWWS outbound call:

TMMETADATA SRVGRP=GWWSGRP SRVID=800
    CLOPT = "-A -- -f <APPDIR>/stockquote.rps"

GWWS    SRVGRP=GWWSGRP SRVID=900
    CLOPT="-A --  -i GW1"

4. Reload the ubbconfig and boot up the application. 

5. Use Client to get the quote of "BEAS".
   ./Client BEAS
