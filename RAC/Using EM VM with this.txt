Steps to use emcc.example.com with Tuxedo racattack:

1) Add network controller to EM VM.  Use Host-only adapter connected to vboxnet1 (same as Vagrant machines)

2) Configure the adapter to have a fixed address of 192.168.78.200

3) Add entry in /etc/host for emcc.example.com on each Vagrant node

4) On the database nodes, chmod g+w /u01

5) Set the password for the oracle account on each node to something (em needs the credentials)
