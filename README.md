Sample applications using Tuxedo and related products

I'd like to see a number of potential sample applications developed.  In particular I think a simple banking application modeled after the standard Tuxedo banking application but updated to leverage the new Tuxedo features and add-ons that have been made since bankapp was originally developed.  What I'm thinking of is showcasing:

- Multiple lanugages: So services developed in each of the supported languages which currently includes C, C++, COBOL, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java.  Perhaps even some "mainframe rehosted" transactions using ART.

- Multiple interfaces:  So both SOAP and REST based interfaces to the services.

- Multiple clients/UIs:  Web based using Jolt, Web based using Tomcat running in the Tuxedo Java server, Mobile or HTML5 using REST
